        could be written from eight strokes. He also devised rules of composition where horizontal strokes are written
        first and characters are composed starting from top to bottom, left to right. Because the symbols were inscribed
        with sharp instruments, the lines were originally angular and in many ways Li Si's achievements were made
        obsolete
        by the appearance of brush and ink (see <a href="#!" title="Chinese calligraphy">Chinese
          calligraphy</a>). The ink-wet brush creates a line quite different from a sharp stylus. It affords variation
        in
        thickness and curve of line. Calligraphy retained the block form of Li Si and his eight strokes but the writer
        was
        free to create characters that emphasized aesthetically pleasing balance and form. The way a character was
        written
        gave a message of style.</p>

      <p class="page-block">At the same time, a style of calligraphy unique to Japan emerged. Writing had been

        could not be written with the borrowed Chinese characters. Japanese calligraphers still fitted the basic
        characters, called <i>kanji</i> <span lang="ja"
                                              xml:lang="ja">(漢字)</span>,
